# Teams Agent Accelerator Project Brief

## Overview
This project implements a modular Teams agent that can handle various capabilities in a group chat context. The agent is designed to be extensible, allowing new capabilities to be added without modifying the core infrastructure.

## Core Requirements
1. Function as an AI assistant in Teams group chats
2. Support multiple independent capabilities (e.g., summarization, action items)
3. Easily extensible architecture for adding new capabilities
4. Efficient message routing to appropriate capabilities
5. Maintainable and scalable codebase

## Project Goals
- Create a flexible foundation for building Teams-based AI assistants
- Enable easy addition of new capabilities
- Maintain clear separation of concerns
- Support multiple simultaneous capabilities
- Provide clear interfaces for capability development

## Success Metrics
- Successful message routing to appropriate capabilities
- Easy integration of new capabilities
- Clear and maintainable codebase structure
- Robust handling of capability responses
