# Teams Agent Product Context

## Purpose
The Teams Agent Accelerator exists to simplify the creation of intelligent assistants that can participate effectively in Teams group chats. It provides a foundation for building agents that can understand and respond to various types of requests through modular capabilities.

## Problems Solved
1. **Complexity Management**
   - Breaks down complex agent functionality into manageable capabilities
   - Simplifies addition of new features through modular architecture
   - Manages message routing and capability coordination

2. **Development Efficiency**
   - Provides clear interfaces for capability development
   - Handles common infrastructure concerns (authentication, message handling)
   - Reduces duplication of effort across capabilities

3. **User Experience**
   - Enables natural interaction through keyword detection
   - Supports multiple capabilities responding to the same message when relevant
   - Maintains consistent interaction patterns across capabilities

## Intended User Experience
1. **For End Users**
   - Natural conversation with the agent in Teams group chats
   - Ability to trigger specific capabilities through keywords
   - Clear and helpful responses from relevant capabilities
   - Seamless interaction across different types of requests

2. **For Developers**
   - Clear path to adding new capabilities
   - Well-defined interfaces and patterns to follow
   - Separation of concerns between core infrastructure and capabilities
   - Easy testing and deployment of individual capabilities

## Success Indicators
- Users can easily trigger desired capabilities
- Developers can add new capabilities with minimal friction
- Responses are relevant and timely
- System maintains performance as capabilities are added
- Clear separation between infrastructure and capability concerns
