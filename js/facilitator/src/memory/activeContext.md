# Teams Agent Active Context

## Current Focus
We have established the foundational architecture for a Teams agent with modular capabilities. The current implementation includes:

1. Core Infrastructure
   - Agent core with Teams integration
   - Message routing system
   - Capability management system
   - Base capability interface

2. Sample Implementation
   - Basic summarization capability
   - Keyword-based triggering
   - Message routing demonstration

## Recent Changes
1. Created core architectural components:
   - Agent core class for Teams integration
   - Message router for capability dispatching
   - Capability manager for plugin management
   - Base capability interface definition

2. Implemented sample capability:
   - Summarization capability as proof of concept
   - Basic keyword matching
   - Simple response generation

## Active Decisions
1. Architecture Choices:
   - Plugin-based capability system for extensibility
   - Keyword-based message routing for simplicity
   - Event-driven design for message handling
   - Interface-driven capability development

2. Implementation Decisions:
   - TypeScript for type safety
   - Modular file structure
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Async/await pattern for message handling

## Current Considerations
1. Technical Infrastructure:
   - Type definitions for Teams SDK
   - Error handling implementation
   - Testing strategy
   - Development workflow

2. Capability Development:
   - Capability lifecycle management
   - Message context handling
   - Response formatting
   - Concurrent processing

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Add error handling for capability registration
2. Implement proper TypeScript types for Teams SDK
3. Add unit tests for core components
4. Create documentation for capability development

### Short-term Goals
1. Implement additional core capabilities:
   - Action item tracking
   - Meeting notes
   - Task management
2. Add capability configuration system
3. Implement message history/context
4. Add capability prioritization

### Long-term Goals
1. Add state management system
2. Implement capability dependencies
3. Add monitoring and logging
4. Create capability marketplace
