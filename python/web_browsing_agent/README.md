# Web Browsing Agent for Microsoft Teams

This sample demonstrates how to build an AI-powered web browsing agent that can be integrated into Microsoft Teams. The agent can perform web browsing tasks on behalf of users, providing real-time visual feedback and interactive responses. It uses [Browser-Use](https://github.com/Browser-Use/Browser-Use) to navigate the web.

## Features

- 🌐 **Autonomous Web Navigation**: Uses AI to understand and execute web browsing tasks
- 📸 **Real-time Visual Feedback**: Shows screenshots of browsing progress via adaptive cards in Adaptive Cards
- 🔄 **Interruptable**: Allows users to stop the browsing session at any time
- 🚢 **Dockerized**: Docker file ready to be deployed to an Azure App Service
